backend concepts

Backend Fundamentals
🖥
Backend development involves creating APIs, servers, and databases to handle server-side logic, business logic, and data storage for web applications.

🚀
Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, is used for backend development to create servers, communicate with databases, and run JavaScript code outside the browser using the V8 engine.

🛠
Express.js, a Node.js framework, simplifies backend development by providing an MVC architecture, middleware for handling requests, and routing to manage application logic.

🗄
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores data in a JavaScript object format and is used with Node.js and Express to handle data storage and retrieval for web applications.

Development Tools and Practices
🔄
Nodemon automatically restarts your Node.js server whenever code changes are saved, allowing for continuous development without manually stopping and starting the server.

📦
npm (Node Package Manager) creates a package.json file managing project dependencies and scripts, which grows as dependencies are added.

🧩
Node.js modules are created using CommonJS syntax, which uses require to import and module.exports to export functionality, allowing for modular code organization.

🐛
console.log statements are used for debugging and viewing output in the terminal when running Node.js code, as browser-specific functions don't work in Node.js.

Express.js and API Development
🌐
Express.js simplifies API development with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) for creating routes and handling requests/responses.

🔒
The POST method is used for secure, form-based data submission and file handling, while the GET method is for retrieving/displaying data.

📊
Data from the frontend can be sent to the backend in three ways: request body (JSON), query parameters (URL), and dynamic URL parameters.

🔑
To access JSON data sent from the frontend in Node.js, it's mandatory to use express.json() middleware, which parses the JSON request body.

Middleware and Authentication
🚦
Middleware in Express.js stands between request and response, running first to check conditions like token authentication before processing the main API request.

🔐
Custom middleware can be created to handle specific tasks like token verification, returning an error response if conditions are not met.

🎛
Middleware can be applied application-wide or route-specific, allowing for granular control over authentication and other checks.

🔗
Multiple middleware functions can be chained together for complex processing, with each performing a specific task before passing control to the next.

Database and Environment Management
🗃
Node.js commonly uses NoSQL databases like MongoDB, which store data in JSON-like documents within collections, allowing for flexible data structures.

🔐
Environment variables in Node.js are stored in a .env file and accessed using process.env, used to store sensitive information like tokens and database credentials securely.

🔌
To use environment variables, install the dotenv package, create a .env file with key-value pairs, and call require('dotenv').config() in your code.

MongoDB Operations
📝
To create a new database in MongoDB, use the command use <database_name>, which creates and switches to the new database.

➕
Insert documents into MongoDB collections using insertOne() for a single document or insertMany() for multiple documents.

🔍
Use find() to retrieve multiple documents matching conditions, and findOne() to get a single document by its unique ObjectId.

✏
Update documents in MongoDB using updateOne() with a condition to find the document and $set to specify the fields and values to update.

Project Structure and Best Practices
🏗
Follow the MVC pattern in projects, with a model created for each collection defining the schema and CRUD operations for structured database interactions.

🔄
The response object for each API should contain a status and message to indicate success or failure, which can be used by the frontend to handle the result.
